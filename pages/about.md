Hi! I'm Colby â€” a data analyst and auditor blending compliance with code.

I use Python, Power BI, SQL, and automation to solve real-world problems across internal audit, fair lending, and business intelligence.

This site showcases my work across dashboards, code-driven audit tools, and data projects.
