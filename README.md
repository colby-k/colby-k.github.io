# Internal Audit & Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my GitHub Pages site, which serves as a professional portfolio showcasing audit-focused tools, analytics, and automation projects.

The site highlights practical work developed in the context of internal audit, with an emphasis on improving efficiency, consistency, documentation quality, and risk coverage.

## Design Principles

Across all projects, the following principles guide development:

- **Audit-first mindset** — tools support auditors; judgment remains with humans
- **Governance and control** — methodology and standards are enforced, not optional
- **Practical implementation** — solutions are designed for real audit environments
- **Clarity and consistency** — outputs are review-ready and defensible

## Technology Stack

- Excel / VBA / Ribbon XML  
- Power BI (data modeling, DAX)  
- SQL  
- Python (pandas, Streamlit)  
- GitHub Pages (Jekyll, Slate theme)
