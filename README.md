# Projects
## [Project 1: SQL Project Data Job Analysis](https://github.com/colby-k/SQL_Project_Data_Job_Analysis)

This project was driven by a desire to better understand the data job market. I wanted to understand what the demand for data analysts is, what skills are in demand, and where the demand for data analysts meets the demand for high salaries.

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I utilized the power of several tools:

- **SQL:** The main tool I used to analyze the data. SQL allowed me to query the database and identify critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The particular database management system, I used to store and analyze my data.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** My preferred code editor for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Python/Jupyter Notebook:** I used to analyze and visualize my data.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

## [Project 2: SQL & Power BI Project Sales Analysis](https://github.com/colby-k/SQL_PowerBI_Project_Sales_Analysis)

This project set out to explore the AdventureWorks dataset from Microsoft SQL Server. The dataset contains sales data for a fictitious company. The goal was to explore the data and create a PowerBI report to answer questions about the company.

For my project I utilized the following tools:

- **Microsoft SQL Server:** Database management system.
- **SQL:** Language used to query the database and export the data for Power BI.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred code editor for SQL queries.
- **Power BI:** Data visualization tool. -Git & GitHub: Version control system and repository.

## [Project 3: Power BI Loan Pricing Analysis](https://github.com/colby-k/PowerBI_Pricing_Analysis)

I was asked to pull some data and summarize loan pricing into "pie charts". I figured this exercise would be a great opportunity to do a little Power BI magic and break away from excel charts and do an interactive report that would be embedded in a slide deck.

The following tools were used to create this project:

- **VS Code:** I used VS Code to write and edit my SQL queries that I used to query the company's data warehouse for loan data.
- **Power BI:** I used Power BI Desktop to create the visualizations and report that I used to present the data.
- **PowerPoint:** I used PowerPoint to create the slide deck that I used to embed the Power BI report to present the data. I preferred this option in order to manipulate the report as questions arised during the presentation, to answer stakeholders' questions.
